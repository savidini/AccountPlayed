**Features:**
- View your account's top played time by class
- View all tracked characters sorted by /played time
- View optional race and faction distribution tabs
- Sorted by (class / total account played) as a percentage
- Toggle distribution tabs between bar and pie chart views
- See total tracked character count in the popup footer
- Small popup UI (resize, drag, move, and scroll as you please!)
- Minimap button to toggle UI (fades when mouse is not over minimap)
- Hover over classes to get a popup of all characters making up the playtime
- Button to toggle between Years/Days or Hours/Min
- Press Escape to close window
- **(NEW)** Rework existing slash commands to use a more consistent name: `/aplayed`
- **(NEW)** `/aplayed minimap` - remove the minimap icon (toggle on/off OR use `/aplayed reset` and run `/reload`)
- **(NEW/Work-in-Progress)** Localized framework currently supporting enUS, zhCN, zhTW, frFR

**Usage:**
- `/aplayed`         - list available commands
- `/aplayed show`    - toggle class time window
- `/aplayed minimap` - toggle the AccountPlayed minimap icon on/off
- `/aplayed reset`   - reset the position of the minimap button to the bottom left of the minimap
- `/apdebug`         - prints a list of all stored characters to chat in the following format: `Realm-Name: TimePlayed (CLASS / RACE / FACTION)`

**Saved data note:**
Race and faction are captured the next time each character reports `/played`.
Older entries are preserved and appear in an `Unknown` bucket until that character is logged in again.

**Deprecated** (will be removed in a future update):
- `/apclasswin` - toggle class time window (use new API: `/aplayed show`)
- `/apresetmap` - reset the position of the minimap button to the bottom left of the minimap (use new API: `/aplayed reset`)
